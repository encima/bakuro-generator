# Bakuro Generator

## About

Python based generator of Bakuro puzzles, a binary version of the popular [kakuro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakuro) puzzle created by Computing At School, with support from Google. Details [here](https://teachinglondoncomputing.org/bakuro/). There are, however, some variations to the original concept.

## Variations 

* Solutions are not limited to 4-bit binary
* Grid sizes are customisable
* 

## Note

I am not affiliated in any way with Computing At School or the creation of Bakuro. I simply saw it as a teaching resource and wanted to create a tool to generate as many of these puzzles as possible, on demand. All credit belongs with the creators of Bakuro and those involved with Computing At School.

This software has been created with as few dependencies as possible, partly as a coding exercise and partly to ensure compatibility with student computers.

## TODO

[ ] Output tables in latex with gridlines
[ ] Allow input and marking of solved grids
